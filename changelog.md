## 1.5.4



## 1.4.8

- Bug fix rename 'automated-evocations' to 'automated-evocations-variant'

## 1.4.7

- Add a new module setting for show the header sheet button only to GM
- Replace icon 'fas fa-users' with 'fas fa-cat' on the actor header sheet button, because the 'fas fa-users' icon is used  from other modules and can create confusion.
- Add a little color (i choose aquamarine) to the header sheet button so is more intuitive ?
- Add module setting for remove the label from the sheet header button very useful for small monitor and mobile and for when there are several modules that fill the header sheet.
- Add automatic github workflow for setup the releases with a gulp file builder (i think is best to have something like this ?)
